## Description

This repository provides the following resources for reproducing the results in our paper:

- Codes for generating the test problems used in the study (`data` folder).
- Source code for Strong Partitioning (`src` folder).
- Sample scripts for running experiments (`scripts` folder).
- Raw experimental results (`results` folder).

Each folder includes a `README` file with additional details.

## Setup and Installation

Follow the instructions in the `src` folder to install and configure the code. The implementation depends on the following software versions:

- Julia 1.6.3
- JuMP 1.1.1
- Alpine 0.4.1
- Gurobi 9.1.2 (via Gurobi.jl 0.11.3)
- BARON 23.6.23 (via BARON.jl 0.8.2)
- CPLEX 22.1.0
- Ipopt 3.14.4 (via Ipopt.jl 1.0.3)
- KNitro 12.4.0 (via KNITRO.jl 0.13.0)
- scikit-learn 0.23.2



## Replicating

To replicate the experiments, follow the instructions provided in the `README` files within each subfolder of the `scripts` directory. The output should match the corresponding results in the `results` folder.
