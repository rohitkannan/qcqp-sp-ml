# Alpine, A global solver for non-convex MINLPs <span style="color:black"></span>


**NOTE**: This code has been modified to incorporate strong partitioning, as described in the following paper:
```bibtex
@article{kannan2025strong,
  author = {Kannan, Rohit and Nagarajan, Harsha and Deka, Deepjyoti},
  title = {Strong Partitioning and a Machine Learning Approximation for Accelerating the Global Optimization of Nonconvex {QCQPs}},
  journal = {INFORMS Journal on Computing},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1287/ijoc.2023.0424},
}
```
Key modifications include:
- Changes to `algorithm.jl` and `multi.jl` to enable calculation of sensitivities for strong partitioning.
- Changes to `amp.jl` to implement strong partitioning (Algorithm 3 in the paper).
- Changes to `solver.jl` to include several new solver options related to strong partitioning.

**The remainder of this README file is reproduced from the original Alpine README.**


"ALPINE: glob(AL) o(P)timization for mixed-(I)nteger programs with (N)onlinear (E)quations", is a novel global optimization solver that uses an adaptive, piecewise convexification scheme and constraint programming methods to solve non-convex Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programs (MINLPs) efficiently. MINLPs are typically "hard" optimization problems which appear in numerous applications (see [MINLPLib.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/MINLPLib.jl)). 

Alpine is entirely built upon [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl) in Julia, which provides incredible flexibility for usage and further development.

Alpine globally solves a given MINLP by:

* Analyzing the problem's expressions (objective & constraints) and applies appropriate convex relaxations and polyhedral outer-approximations

* Performing sequential optimization-based bound tightening (OBBT) and an iterative MIP-based adaptive partitioning scheme via piecewise polyhedral relaxations with a guarantee of global convergence

**Allowable nonlinearities**: Alpine can currently handle MINLPs with polynomials in constraints and/or in the objective. Currently, there is no support for exponential cones and Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) cones in MINLPs. Alpine is also a good fit for subsets of the MINLP family, e.g., Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrainted Quadradic Programs (MIQCQPs), Non-Linear Programs (NLPs), etc.

## Installation and Usage

Alpine can be installed through the Julia package manager:

`julia> Pkg.add("Alpine")`

Developers: Any further development of Alpine can be conducted on a new branch or a forked repo.

Check the "test/examples" folder on how to use this package. 

## Underlying solvers

Though the MIP-based bounding algorithm implemented in Alpine is quite involved, most of the computational bottleneck arises in the underlying MIP solvers. Since every iteration of Alpine solves an MIP sub-problem, which is typically a convex MILP/MIQCQP, Alpine's run time heavily depends on the run-time of these solvers. For the best performance of Alpine, we recommend using the commercial solver [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com), which is avaible [free](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/) for academic purposes. However, due to the flexibility offered by [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl), the following MIP and NLP solvers are supported in Alpine:
